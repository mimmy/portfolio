<ul>
	<li>An amateur singer and dancer</li>
	<li>I find animals astonishing</li>
	<li>I have a crazy Jack Russel Terrier</li>
	<li>A HUGE Doctor Whovian</li>
	<li>Pink and grey make me smile</li>
	<li>I enjoy drinking cold beer</li>
	<li>I draw with pencils</li>
	<li>I make polymer clay jewelry</li>
	<li>The Sherlock Holmes books inspire me</li>
	</ul>
<p>The most important experience in my life was singing in the Bulgarian National Radio 
	Children's Choir for almost 10 years. The choir is famous worldwide with its strict discipline.
	Every child goes through a four-year 
	training prior to entering the choir, learning how to sing, behave, be responsible for the younger kids, adapt and follow strict regime as a preparation for the long and frequent concert tours.</p>
	<p> Many give up, but I was one of the lucky few that stayed in the choir until the end. This made me tough, devoted 
	and consistent. It taught me how to respect the others, how to be organized and organize people 
	around me, work in a team and most importantly - how to be self-disciplined and strong.</p></div>


<div id="professional"><h2>The coder within</h2>
	<h4>A 3-rd semester Multimedia Design student, a future web and mobile designer and developer.</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>HTML5/CSS3 enthusiast</li>
	<li>Advancing with JavaScript and PHP</li>
	<li>Experimenting with Java for Android and MySQL</li>
	<li>Escaping procrastination through coding</li>
	<li>Curious about the new coding trends</li>
	</ul>
	<!--<p>Learning about code is not just a school thing to me - it is also a huge hobby of mine.
I feel that creating websites is not the limit for all of the things that can be done with my skills so far.
This challenges me personally to push these limits as much as I can and see how far I can reach. Like Einstein said - ”The more I learn,
the more I realize how much I don’t know” and that's how I feel when I do coding - i see all the amazing things i can do if I put more effort
into my work. I feel that being motivated from the inside is my biggest strength as an individual and as a professional.</p>
<p>Even if sometimes I have to do it, I don't prefer working with code templates.
I prefer putting the pieces together - it's much more fun, it's a great exercise and it gives you freedom to do anything you want.</p>-->
<p>Coding is a very special personal passion of mine.
I have always been mentally challenged and motivated by mind engaging activities and I use that 
as a trick to stay focused when I can't. If I find myself postponing a non-coding 
task, I stimulate my brain by playing brain games, solving a riddles 
or working with code. The thrill of finding solutions is like a fuel to my brain.
I feel that being motivated from the inside is my biggest strength as an individual 
and as a professional.</p>

<p>I know that I'm very far away from reaching the limits of what can be done with my skills,
so I'm trying to push my own limits and see how far I can reach. Like Einstein said - ”The more I learn, the more I realize how
much I don’t know” and I can feel it when I code. I really hope that this internship will
open my eyes even more and that I will be able to contribute for something important and
special.</p>
