<h3><strong>SKILLS:</strong> HTML5, CSS, JAVASCRIPT</h3>
<div id="description">
<p><strong>THIS PORTFOLIO</strong> is not just a shell in which I put my projects, 
	but also the most important and recent project of mine that really shows my 
	skills to create dynamic content for the web. It is focused on my jquery and php skills. 
	I'm also expressing my passion for CSS3 - for the menu buttons and "about me" image I 
	used CSS3 transitions and animations instead of javascript.</p>
<p><strong>TO CREATE</strong> most of the html content for the projects' page dynamically, 
	I use PHP to make a div for each .jpg file in a specific folder with a data-name generated from 
	the image name. That way if I want to add a new project, I just have to add the new image in the 
	right folder with an appropriate name. The modals that pop-up are displayed with ajax, and the name of 
	the .php file that the function has to get and load is also generated from the data-name name in the div.</p>
<p><strong>IT IS ALSO CAREFULLY DESIGNED BY ME</strong>, and I think it displays my effort in design classes and 
	ability to create a simple, pleasant design pretty well. The logo is an SVG, which is good both for the size 
	of the site and for the good quality of the image.</p></div>
