<p><strong>THE CLIENT</strong> for this project was a Romanian bakery in Denmark who had 
	just opened their first confectionery. The most important requirement for the website was 
	an option to order online. The client didn't want any login forms or online payment.</p>
	<p><strong>OUR IDEA</strong> was to create an order form, in which the customer can choose 
		the amount of cake from a field under each picture and view, edit and send his current order 
		with a basic contact form. That way there's both a simple, visual way for the customer to 
		order and the client keeps the simplicity of receiving the orders by email. BiaBakery found 
		the solution very elegant and simple.</p><p><strong>THE SOLUTION</strong> 
		that I came up with as the coder was to use HTML5 forms and php. The fields under the pictures belong 
		to a form. I get the information from it and echo it inside the confirmation form so that it can be 
		viewed and edited by the customer.</p>
		<p>The system is now in use on <a href="http://biabakery.dk"  target="_blank">http://biabakery.dk</a>.
