<p><strong>THIS WORDPRESS THEME</strong> is the one I was using in my Polymer clay blog. It’s my first 
	attempt for creating a child theme and it worked out pretty well. The theme is designed entirely by 
	me for my main target group – creative teenagers who look for cute polymer clay tutorials or inspiring projects 
	on the web. The blog was a part of a school project that ended in November, so it hasn’t been updated 
	since, but the project was pretty successful. The number of visitors per day was constantly increasing 
	and about 20% of them were regular visitors.</p>
